Rare fish can be found occasionally, and they can be worth some extra silver!
You can massively improve the chance of rare fish spawning using bait. The easiest bait to get is Rot Cakes, which can be crafted with 5 rotten flesh and 4 bread in a crafting table.

Earn fishing tokens as well as money by completing the Catch of the Day! Use `/catchoftheday` to see today's tasks.

## Fish

There are many different types of fish you can catch. When you catch your first fish you will be given a Fishing Pouch to hold them all. Fish have Quality ratings just like Geodes, and you will be given Fishing Legacy points for collecting all 5 ratings for each species of fish.
