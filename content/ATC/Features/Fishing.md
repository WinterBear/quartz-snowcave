Rare fish can be found occasionally, and they can be worth some extra silver!
You can massively improve the chance of rare fish spawning using bait. The easiest bait to get is Rot Cakes, which can be crafted with 5 rotten flesh and 4 bread in a crafting table.

Earn fishing tokens as well as money by completing the Catch of the Day! Use /catchoftheday to see today's tasks.
